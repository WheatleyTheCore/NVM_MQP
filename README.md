# NVM MQP

### Quick-Start
run `git clone --recursive https://github.com/WheatleyTheCore/NVM_MQP.git` to clone this repo and the data subrepos.

After that, create a python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv vnev` and activate it with `source venv/bin/activate` 
so that you can install packages and run things from a virtual environment. This step is optional if you are brave and don't 
care if things potentially affect system packages.

Then install the libraries with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Then, run the get_irs_for_ex script in the sandbox directory to install the IRs I used.
